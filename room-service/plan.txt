- Introduction to the game
- A few pictures
- But what's interesting is how it works
- x many lines of C++, hardware manifest
- OMG, so much wiring
- Platformio being amazing
- Native Builds
    - Split running game into two parts.
    - 1.  Updating the game state.
    - 2a. Updating the hardware.
    - 2b. Reading player input (which is also updating hardware).
    - Can run test suites and native code by just running 1.
    - Can run VALGRIND. OMG OMG.
- Test suites
- (maybe) Memory management.
    - Stack based good, heap based bad.
    - Flag to indicate re-use of events.
    - You never want to debug memory fragmentation on embedded hardware.
    - Turns out the path-finder was to blame.
- Future improvements
- Links to code
- Thank you!
