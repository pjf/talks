- Zappa screenshot
- Deploy (and fail)
- Make credentials file (IAM, etc)
- Deploy again (and fail?)
- Make config file (region)
- Run `aws configure` rather than rolling my own
- Update config to not delete the local zip
- Cry into google a lot
- Discover that zip files can contain unix permissions
- Discover that AWS cares a lot about this
- File https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/issues/484
- Get it working, yay!
- `zappa update production` rocks
- `zappa tail production` is great!
