# Space: The next 400 years

## What's here?

- `space.pinpp` - Top level structure for the talk.
- `topics/*` - Individual topic arcs, used by the above
- `plan.txt` - Original talk notes and plans. May not be relevant to anything at all.

## Building and running

- Install `pinpp`, the pinpoint pre-processor (`cpanm App::Pinpp`)
- Install `pinpoint`, a neat presentation tool (`apt-get install pinpoint`)
- `make`
- `./space.pin`

Everything is a plain text file under the hood, so you can just read files in
your editor if you don't want to muck around with `pinpoint` or `pinpp`

## Bonus Video

You should go watch
[Wanderers](http://www.erikwernquist.com/wanderers/film.html), a four-minute
film by Erik Wernquist that closely matches what I'd love to see as the future
of humanity in space.
