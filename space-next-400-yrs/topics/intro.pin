The next 400 years

Paul Fenwick
--
Why 400
years?
--
Space exploration
takes time
--
X many years
to Mars
--
Long lead-times
to projects
--
People don't
think far
ahead

# Certainly not beyond their lifespans
--
Important of
space for
humanity

# I want to look forward to...
--
Infinity...
and beyond!
