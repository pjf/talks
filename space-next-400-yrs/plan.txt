- Intro
- Why 400 years
    - Beyond our natural lifespans
    - Let's us explore why space is *really* important for humanity
- Infinity and beyond joke

## Why is space important?

- Why space?
    - Resource depletion on Earth
    - (Mining.com) graph
    - OMG, it's from MINING.COM, the most pro-mining website there is.
    - The UN predicts we're going to need up to TEN TIMES the production we have now.
    - As we deplete resources, we go after worse sources
    - Iron Ore is a case in point. There's heaps of it, but it's mostly shite.
    - More expensive to obtain, and more destructive to mine
    - But all our resources originally came from space
    - So there's an obvious way to solve, or at least delay, resource shortages
    - FUCKING RECYCLING!
    - SRSLY! COULD WE DO THAT PLEASE?
    - No? Okay, maybe asteroids then.

    - Getting stuff to space is *expensive*
    - I'm pro-human. I want humanity to survive beyond my lifespan.
    - Curiosity and exploration! Is there life elsewhere?

## Asteroid mining

- What minerals are hard on earth, but easy on asteroids?

- Mining tech is also the *same* tech we'd use to divert asteroid strikes
- Mining tech could also be used to weaponise asteroids. 

- a single 500m-wide carbonaceous asteroid could supply more than 200 times the propellant used in all the rockets ever launched in human history. (Extreme Mining quote)

- Mention an extinction event or two from asteroid strikes?
    - 10km (radius? diameter?) asteroid is probably extinction-level
    - 1+km probably extinction level
    - Comets - We're fucked; super high velocities
    - 50m - pretty bad (Barringer Crater); 10 megaton explosion, 12.8km/sec
    - Earth moves one planetary length every 425 seconds (~7 minutes)
        - Only need to delay or advance an asteroid by 7 minutes to avoid collision.

- Interplanetary(?) Transport Network

- Orbital resource utilisation saves us *huge* lifting costs
    - Water for propellant and life support
    - Metals for building things
    - Stone for structures

## Power generation

- Solar power satellites
    - SO MUCH BETTER THAN EARTH SOLAR
    - NO NIGHT-TIME KTHX (50% losses)
    - No Atmosphere (50% losses)
    - Many Energy 
    - Such Watts!
    - Wow!
    - Microwave beaming
    - Laser power beaming(!)

    - Lunar materials can provide 99% of what's needed for an SPS {{cite}}
        - Much lower launch costs


- He3 mining?

## Space industry

- Aerated materials
- Orbital shipyards
- Replicator bots on the moon

## Why Water is best

- Fuel
- Radiation Shielding
- Life support

## Getting there

### Solar sails (ikaros)

- Already tested!
- Japanese spacecraft are best
    - Movies, Songs, twitter accts
- Reusable
- *Much* better if manufactured in space, because less unfurling risks
- Suitable for bulk transport

## EM drive

- Reactionless drive
- Not quite sure how it works
- Not quite sure *if* it works
- Basically magic, like everything with microwaves in it.

### Other things

- Lazor propulsion
    - Really fun
    - Video of the little laser craft?

- Neumann Drive
    - Australian invention
    - Uses metallic fuels
    - Creator is pretty fun

- STAR TRAM!
    - Plasma windows ftw!

- Launch loops
    - Kind of like space fountains, but less bad when they fall

- Magnetic sails <3!!
    - I swear, these are just an awesome concept.

- Skyhooks
    - Great to attach to asteroids!

## Staying there

- Space elevator (hard)
- Space fountain (aww yis)
    - Not good when it falls over

## Screwing it up

- Kessler Syndrome
- Climate change
- Weaponised asteroids

## Interstellar travel

- Starwisps?
- Lightships

## Other

- I'm on a boat video!
